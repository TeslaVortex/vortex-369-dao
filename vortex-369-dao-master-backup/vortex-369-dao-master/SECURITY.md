# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep Vortex-369-DAO safe! ❤️  
We take security very seriously — especially since this involves blockchain/DAO/smart contracts.

## Supported Versions

We only actively support the **latest released version** (and maybe the previous one during transition).  
Older versions are not patched for security issues.

| Version          | Supported          | Notes                              |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Latest release   | ✅ Yes             | Gets security fixes                |
| Previous release | ⚠️ Sometimes       | Only if major upgrade pending      |
| All older        | ❌ No              | Upgrade recommended                |

(Change this table later when you have real version tags like v1.0.0)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please report privately — do NOT open a public issue!**  
We want to fix things before bad actors see them.

**Best way to report:**
- Go to the **Security** tab → **Report a Vulnerability** (GitHub's private form — super easy!)
- OR email us privately: vortex369x [at] proton.me (or your preferred secure email)

**What to include in your report:**
- Description of the bug/vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (PoC code is super helpful!)
- Affected versions/files (e.g., which smart contract)
- Possible impact (e.g., "can drain funds" or "steal votes")

**What happens next?**
- We reply within **48 hours** to confirm we received it.
- We aim to update you every **7 days** (or faster if urgent).
- If accepted: we credit you (if you want) + fix it → release patch.
- If not a real vuln: we explain politely why.

We love responsible disclosure!  
Big thanks to anyone who reports — you help protect the whole community. 🙏✨

Happy hunting! 🕵️‍♂️
