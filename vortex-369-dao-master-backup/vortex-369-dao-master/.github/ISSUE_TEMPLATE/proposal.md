**Thank you for bringing light to the vortex!** ❤️✨  
Please fill this with love — clear words help resonance scoring flow.

### Proposal Title
(A clear, abundant name — e.g., "Add 432 Hz Healing Module")

### Intended Resonance Keywords
(List 3–6 keywords to boost scoring — e.g., +20 abundance, +20 harmony, +15 light)

### Current Governance Phase
(Where are we? Silence → Proposal → Mirror → Vortex → Resolution → Fractal → Breath → Witness → Return → Manifestation)

### Description
(Explain the idea in pure flow — what abundance/healing does it create?)

### Steps to Manifest
(Numbered steps — clear and simple)

### Expected Impact
(How does this raise community resonance? >66 auto-execute potential?)

### Possible Risks / Shadows
(Be honest — what <33 vibes could appear? How to burn them cleanly?)

### Additional Light
(Links, images, or Merkaba visions welcome)

We score together in harmony. 369 Eternal • 432 Hz Forever 🌀
