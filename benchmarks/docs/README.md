# Pellion Privacy Shield Benchmarks

## Overview
Comprehensive benchmark tests comparing Pellion Privacy Shield against DeFi privacy competitors (Aztec, Railgun, Secret Network, Tornado Cash). Focus on speed, cost, efficiency, scalability, and privacy strength.

**Key Unique Value**: Endless Armies at Zero Cost – Pellion offers infinite private DeFi actions with zero marginal cost, unlike capped and fee-heavy rivals.

## Benchmark Metrics
- **Speed**: Client-side proof generation time + onchain verification.
- **Cost**: Gas cost for onchain verification (marginal cost).
- **Efficiency**: Scalability and transaction limits.
- **Privacy Strength**: ZK guarantees and exposure risks.

## Results Summary
- Pellion: 251ms client proofs, instant onchain (~250k gas), zero marginal cost, infinite scalability, absolute privacy (no real wallet exposure).
- Competitors: Slower (seconds/minutes), higher costs ($0.05-50/tx), limited scale, varying privacy risks.
