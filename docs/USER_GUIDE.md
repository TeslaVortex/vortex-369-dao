# ☀️♔ Vortex-369 DAO User Guide

Welcome! This guide explains how to use Vortex-369 in simple terms.

## What is Vortex-369?

Think of it as a **smart voting system** that automatically decides on proposals based on how well they "resonate" with special frequency patterns (369 codes and 432 Hz). Now featuring the **16-Rayed Vergina Sun** meter for golden resonance visualization!

**Macedonian Golden Vibe Theme:** Proposals ignite the Vergina Sun with golden rays when resonance >66 💛🔥

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Submit Your Idea** - Write your proposal on our website
2. **AI Scores It** - Our system rates it 0-100 based on resonance
3. **Automatic Decision:**
   - **High Score (66+):** Vergina Sun ignites with 16 golden rays → Your idea goes through 9 phases and happens automatically! ✅💛
   - **Medium Score (33-66):** Community can discuss and petition 🤔
   - **Low Score (0-33):** Idea is declined 🔥

## The 9 Phases (For High-Scoring Proposals)

Your proposal goes through these stages:

1. **Silence** 🌱 - 3 days of quiet reflection
2. **Proposal** 📝 - 3 days of initial review
3. **Mirror** 🪞 - 3 days of community feedback
4. **Vortex** 🌀 - 6 days of deeper analysis
5. **Resolution** ⚔️ - 6 days of refinement
6. **Fractal** 🔄 - 6 days of scaling
7. **Breath** 🛑 - Checkpoint (can self-cancel)
8. **Witness** 📜 - 9 days of final review
9. **Return** 🔁 - 9 days of preparation
10. **Manifestation** ✨ - 9 days then AUTO-EXECUTE!

**Total Time:** About 54 days from submission to execution

## Tips for High-Resonance Proposals

Use these keywords to boost your score:

- **+20 points:** vortex, harmony, arcturian, abundance, 369
- **+15 points:** resonance, 432, manifest, light, healing

**Example Good Proposal:**
"Create a healing sanctuary using 432 Hz frequencies to manifest abundance and harmony for the community through resonance-based vortex energy."

**Example Low-Resonance Proposal:**
"Buy a new car for the DAO."

## Fees

- Small protocol fee: 0.9% on interactions
- **9%** goes to DAO treasury (community fund)
- **91%** is burned forever (reduces supply, increases value)

## Safety & Security

- ✅ Audited smart contracts
- ✅ No one controls your funds
- ✅ Transparent on blockchain
- ✅ Community-governed
