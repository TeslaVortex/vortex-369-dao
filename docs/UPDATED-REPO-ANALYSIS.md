```

#### 2. Set Up Multi-Sig
```bash
# Create Gnosis Safe
1. Go to https://safe.global
2. Create Safe on Base
3. Add 3-5 trusted signers
4. Transfer admin role
```

#### 3. Run Comprehensive Tests
```bash
# Use your new testing infrastructure
./tools/scripts/test-all.sh  # (if you added this)

# Or manually:
cd backend && cargo test
cd contracts && forge test -vvv
cd web && npm test
```

---

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Next Week):
